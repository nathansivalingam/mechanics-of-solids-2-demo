# Mechanics of Solids 2 (Demonstration Aid)
- The formulae found in this repository can be used to double check hand written calculations required to solve problems relating to the mechanics of solids. 
- DISCLAIMER: While using the code is likely faster than conducting the calculations by hand, it is advised that students feel confident completing questions without third-party software (excl. physical calculator). This is because exams may or may not allow the use of code/online calculators.

### How to use
1. Make sure that you have MATLAB installed on your computer.
2. Download the program that you would like to use and open it on MATLAB (or VSCode if you have the MATLAB extension).
3. Change the values of the variables (often towards the top of the program) to cater to the question.
4. Run the file and observe the answers generated in the terminal.

Best of Luck!!!
